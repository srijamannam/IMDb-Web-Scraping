# IMDb-Web-Scraping
This is the website I used to scrape movie data from :https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating


I created a dataframe consisting of the columns :Movie Name,Year of Release, Watch Time, Movie Rating, Metascore of movie, Votes, Gross Income, Description of the movie
