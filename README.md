# IMDb-Web-Scraping
This is the website I used to scrape IMDB movie data from: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating

I converted raw JSON data into a readable data frame consisting of the columns: Movie Name, Year of Release, Watch Time, Movie Rating, Metascore of movie, Votes, Gross Income, Description of the movie
